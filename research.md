# Actinide Coordination Chemistry

## Catalyst Development Based on Low-Valent Uranium Complexes

In our efforts to activate small molecules of industrial and biological importance, we have turned our attention to coordinatively unsaturated, reactive uranium coordination complexes. 
For example, the chelating triazacyclononane (tacn), single N, and arene-anchored tris­(aryloxide) ligands, (ArO)3tacn3–, (ArO)3N3–, and (ArO)3mes3– have provided access to reactive coordination compounds of uranium in oxidation states II, III, IV, V, and VI with tailorable steric and electronic profiles. 
These complexes display a pro­nounced selectivity and reactivity in reactions with carbon dioxide, related small heteroallene molecules (COS and CS2), and H2O.

Recently, the stoichio­metric and catalytic “disproportionation” of CO2 to CO and CO32– via reductive cleavage of CO2 was accomplished. 
In analogy, we were able to isolate an entire series of chalco­genide mixed-carbonate complexes by reacting bridged chalco­genide complexes U‒E‒U (E = S, Se, Te) with CO2, CS2, and COS. 
With respect to fundamental understanding of actinide chemistry, the molecular and electronic structure of a new oxidation state in U coordination chemistry, namely U(II), with a 5f 4 quintet ground state was stabilized by a mesitylene anchored tris­(aryloxide) ligand. 
In K(crypt)­[((Ad,MeArO)3­mes)­U], the U(II) center is supported by d backbonding, a general motive of the (ArO)3mes3– ligand.

In analogy to the CO2 reduction, a rare U(IV) hydroxo complex, [((Ad,MeArO)3mes)U(OH)], with a terminal OH functionality was synthesized by selective reduction of H2O with the U(III) complex [((Ad,MeArO)3mes)U]. 
Mechanistic studies were performed to understand this fundamental reaction, establishing the basis of catalytic H2O reduction for H2 evolution. 
Comprehensive electrochemical studies revealed that the U(III) complex can be regenerated in a catalytic cycle combining chemical and electrochemical reaction steps to produce H2 from water.
Most recent projects comprise the development of air and water stable U(IV) complexes for catalysis, the utilization of U(III) species with monodentate ligands for N2, N2O and NO activation, and finally the immobilization of catalysts on electrode surfaces.

# Organometallic Chemistry

## Tripodal N-Heterocyclic Carbene Ligands for High-Valent Reactive Metal Complexes

Transition metal coordination compounds in high oxidation states are active intermediates in many biocatalytic cycles. 
In this context, the study of high valent transition metal complexes featuring the terminal, multiple bonded oxido (O2–) and nitrido (N3–) ligands is of significant and current interest due to their proposed intermediacy in biological systems and industrial processes. 
Examples include O- and N-atom transfer chemistry, epoxidation and aziridination catalysis, water-splitting catalysis with Co-oxo species and biological ammonia synthesis performed by iron nitride intermediates stabilized by the nitrogenase enzyme. 
Spectroscopic evidence for these inter­mediates is often based on studies of well-defined inorganic coordination complexes modeling the natural analogues. 
The synthesis and characterization of high-valent metal oxo and nitrido model compounds is therefore often key to delineating the nature and reactivity of these unusually reactive species and assigning their role e.g. in water splitting catalysis and ammonia synthesis.
Insight into the molecular and electronic structure of complexes that stabilize the intermediate [FeºN] entity appears to be valuable in unveiling the key steps of both biological (nitrogenase) and industrial (Haber-Bosch process) NH3 synthesis.

The Meyer group’s approach to high-valent complexes is based on our signature tripodal NHC ligands, which provide a powerful platform for small molecule activation chemistry. 
This is due to the ligand field resulting from the trigonal carbene environment enabling the stabilization of the desired and highly unusual metal to ligand multiple bonds.

![Meyer Group](/assets/img/Carbeneligands_klein.jpg)

We have discovered that employing tripodal N-heterocyclic carbene chelates developed by us, allows for the synthesis, isolation as well as the structural and spectroscopic characterization of discrete mid- and high valent imido, nitride, and peroxo complexes.

With these ligands we successfully prepared and fully characterized a series of high- and mid-valent manganese, cobalt and iron nitrido complexes. 
The X-ray structure of the iron(IV) nitrido complex is the first structural verification of the [FeN] synthon that has been recognized as the reactive intermediate in the industrial Haber–Bosch process. 
Reactivity studies of the Fe(V) species include the reaction of an FeVºN with water to yield ammonia in near quantitative yields.

# Heterogenous Catalysis

## photochemistry: photocatalytic water splitting at doped semiconductor materials

![Meyer Group](/assets/img/Wasserspaltung.png)

Zitat: “Yes, my friends, I believe that water will one day be employed as fuel, that hydrogen and oxygen which constitute it, used singly or together, will furnish an inexhaustible source of heat and light, of an intensity of which coal is not capable…. water will be the coal of the future.”

Jules Verne (The Mysterious Island, 1874)

After the 20th century has been known as the "hydrocarbon century", it is likely that the next one hundred years will be called the "hydrogen century." 
Hydrogen as non-polluting, CO2-free energy carrier has been considered an ideal way to confront the depletion and environmental problems of fossil fuels. 
The main objective of the project is the overall splitting of water to oxygen and hydrogen using sunlight as clean, renewable, and abundant source of energy. 
Since water itself does not absorb noticeable radiation within the solar spectrum, a light absorbing species (sensitizer) must be employed to convert the radiant energy to chemical energy. 
The approach to the subject by heterogeneous catalysis takes advantage of photochemically stable inorganic materials such as semiconductors. 
Upon irradiation electron-hole pairs are formed and trapped at reactive surface sites from where interfacial electron transfer (IFET) reactions to adsorbed water have to compete with the undesirable processes of charge recombination and reactions with the semiconductor itself (photocorrosion). 
The overall efficiency of semiconductor catalyzed reactions depends in a complicated fashion on various parameters such as the semiconductors modification, surface structure, particle size or the nature of substrate adsorption at the solid/liquid interface. 
Tantalates have recently attracted attention as a new group of materials for water splitting.
However, due to bandgap energies of ~ 4.0 eV for most tantalates, light of l ≤ 300 nm is required for excitation and it remains a challenge to extend the response to solar light and increase the photocatalytic activity for water splitting at that.

# Supramolecular Chemistry

## Supramolecularly Stabilized Transition Metal Complexes

One research project will be the synthesis and stabilization of high-valent early first-row transition metal complexes by encapsulation in zeolite cages. 
While initial studies will focus on terminal oxo and nitrido complexes, the investigation of a variety of chalcogenido and pnictogenido compounds of V, Cr, Mn and Fe is envisioned. 
Major goals of this project include in situ spectroscopic characterization of reactive species and exploration of their catalytic applications.

# Bioinorganic Chemistry

## Model Compounds for the Active Site of Hydroxylamine Oxidoreductase

The design of water-soluble, amine and imine macrocyclic ligands is a bioinorganic approach to synthesize simple inorganic analogues to the active site P-460 of Hydroxylamine Oxidoreductase (HAO). 
This enzyme HAO catalyzes the four-electron oxidative conversion of hydroxylamine to nitrite in the biological nitrogen cycle. 
The exploration of the complexes' reactivity towards substrates such as NH2OH, N2H4, N2O, and NO is envisioned. 
The ultimate goal of this research is to broaden our understanding of the interplay of the active site, covalently bound and potentially redox-active side-chains, metal-metal interactions, and electron acceptors during the course of the hydroxylamine oxidation.
