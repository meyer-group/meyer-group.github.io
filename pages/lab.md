## Synthesis

We are a synthetic group with additional strong emphasis on applied spectroscopy. 
A universal theme in our research is the synthesis and characterization of reactive coordination complexes. 
These molecules are stabilized either using an appropriate ligand system or by means of encapsulation strategies. 
Therefore, the development and synthesis of novel organic macrocyclic ligands capable to coordinate and stabilize highly reactive species is of great interest. 
The synthesis of porous materials is another objective. 
Reactivity studies shall induce a response on the improvement of the preparative chemical synthesis, including fine-tuning of the ligand and the porous materials.


## Solvent Purification System

We have set up a solid state solvent purification system in our laboratory. 
This system (by glass contour) has proven to be much safer over conventional distillation apparatuses. 
It will complement our efforts to handle highly reactive species under very careful conditions. The solvent dispensing system provides common solvents such as acetonitrile, THF, ether, toluene, pentane, and methylenechloride air- and water free. 
The solvents are stored in fire-proof cabinets in stainless-steel reservoirs, pressurized with ultra-pure argon, and passed through two sequential columns to remove any water and trace impurities as well as oxygen. 
The system is equipped with a cross-diffusion prevention between the solvents and a vacuum transfer device for refilling the solvent kegs without pouring. 
The solvent lines are plumbed directly into the glove-box, which allows to collect solvents at a "filling station" inside the boxes as well as at the stand.

## Inert-Atmosphere Techniques

Some of our compounds may be extremely air and/or moisture sensitive. 
Therefore, our laboratory is set up with a manifold of regular Schlenk-type argon/vacuum lines.
For convenient handling of these molecules, manipulations are performed in inert-atmosphere boxes. The laboratories are equipped with a single-box, designated for uranium chemistry only, and a double-box. 
Both boxes (MBRAUN Labmaster) are equipped with:

- PLC Controller
- Solid-State Oxygen Analyzer
- Antechambers with Heatable Trays and Automatic Antechamber evac/refill Controller
- Internal Charcoal Traps
- Floor Mounted Cold-Well (with liquid Nitrogen Dewar)
- -40 Degree Celsius Freezer
- Automatic Purge Valves
- Static Eliminators

## EPR-spectroscopy

Although multinuclear NMR spectroscopy will be the "everyday" method to characterize our new compounds, we expect to synthesize and focus on paramagnetic species as well. 
For the characterization of paramagnetic transition-metal complexes we routinely use a state-of-the-art EPR spectrometer. 
The Electron-Paramagnetic-Resonance spectrometer used is a JEOL continuous wave spectrometer JES-FA200 equipped with an X-band high-power low-noise Dual-Gunn oscillator bridge (microwave source) and a high sensitivity cylindrical mode cavity. 
For high-accuracy measurements the system carries a Hall field controller as well as an X-band digital frequency counter. 
For low-temperature experiments the spectrometer is equipped with a helium cryostat system to record spectra down to as low as 4 K.

## Magnetochemistry

In order to fully understand the electronic structure (and ultimately the reactivity due to the particular electron distribution within the molecule) we apply magnetic susceptibility measurements using a SQUID magnetometer. 
For iron containing complexes, 57Fe-Mössbauer spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy are used as complementary tools for probing molecular magnetism and for elucidating the electronic structure of transition metal complexes.

## Mössbauer Spectroscopy

Two Mössbauer instruments for 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy are available which each consist of a WissEl Mössbauer spectrometer (MRG-500), a 57Co/Rh radiation source and an MBBC-HE0106 MÖSSBAUER He/N2 cryostat for experiments between 5 and 300 K. 
Isomer shifts are determined relative to a-iron at 298 K. WinNormos for Igor Pro software is used for the quantitative evaluation of the spectral parameters (least-squares fitting to Lorentzian peaks). 
The minimum experimental line widths are 0.20 mms-1.

## Electrochemistry

Electrochemistry is applied in our group to characterize the redox properties of metal complexes and to elucidate catalytic processes of electrochemical reactions. 
The laboratory is currently equipped with two Potentionstats/Galvanostats: mAutolab TYPE III and Autolab PGSTAT204. 
The former potentionstat is located in a glove-box so that oxygen- or moisture-sensitive samples can be studied in the strictly inert atmosphere. 
Both setups are able to conduct most standard electrochemical techniques, including potential step and sweep methods (linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry etc), polarography, and pulse voltammetric methods (differential pulse voltammetry, square wave voltammetry etc) and stationary polarization methods (chronopotentiometry and chronoamperometry). 
PGSTAT204 is equipped with a FRA32M module for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement. 
A wide range of Metrohm Autolab accessories are available, such as rotating disc electrode (RDE) and motor controller (up to 10,000 rpm), electrochemical cells of different sizes (3~50 mL), and various electrodes, to meet different purposes in either aqueous or organic medium.

## X-ray crystallography

Extended single crystal X-ray diffraction studies are performed in our laboratory in order to gain detailed structural insight for understanding the properties and reactivity behavior of our newly synthesized coordination compounds. 
As many of the resulting uranium and iron as well as other transition metal complexes are paramagnetic compounds single crystal structure determination often is the only method providing precise structural information of the resulting complexes.

Our laboratory is equipped with three single-crystal diffractometers:

- State-of-the-art Bruker-Nonius Kappa APEX II Duo diffractometer operated with an Incoatec High Brilliance IµS Mo microsource and an IµS  Cu source. 
Both microfocus sources are equipped with QUAZAR focusing X-ray optics. 
Cooling of our samples is provided by an Oxford Cryosystems Series 700 low temperature device.
This instrument is especially designed for structure determinations on very small crystalline samples with crystal sizes of down to 50 µm and even smaller.
