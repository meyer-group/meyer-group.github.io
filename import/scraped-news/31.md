This was a first!!!  The Meyer  group participated in the “Iron Chemist” (Sept. 2008) competition here at the University of Erlangen.  Although we nominated two teams (team U238  and Fe57) for the triathlon competition, we unfortunately were not  quite as physically “fit” as some of the other teams and had to resort to our  famous team spirit and sportsmanship to nevertheless enjoy the competition.  This sportsmanship is clearly demonstrated in  the picture below in which Dr. Jörg Sutter and Prof. Sven Rau are shaking hands  as they pass the finish line at the same time!  Well done guys!
