Welcome to our guest Dr. Alistair Frey from the University of Sussex,  Brighton, UK! 
He is visiting us for 4 weeks (in April 2009) to breathe life into our infamous  arsenic generator. It was build by our machine shop a while ago and has since  been waiting to produce yellow arsenic for uranium chemistry. We are happy to  have Alistair in town and are looking forward to lots of chemistry and  camaraderie!
