title: Congrats to Prof. Dan Mindiola
---

Congratulations to Prof. Daniel Mindiola who was awarded the prestigious “Friedrich Wilhelm  Bessel Research Award” awarded by Germany’s Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (2009). 
It will allow him to visit Germany for an extended research stay. 
During this visit he will split his time and perform experiments in the laboratories of Prof. Herbert Roesky at the University of Göttingen as well as our laboratory at Erlangen. 
We are looking forward to host this truly amazing synthetic chemist, learn from him and have lots of fun with him and his family.
