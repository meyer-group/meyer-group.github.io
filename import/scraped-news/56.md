Ingrid, 
  Oanh and Patrick went to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation 
    Laboratory (SSRL) to collect our first XANES and XAFS 
      data on our uranium complexes. This study is carried 
    out in collaboration with Dr. Steve Conradson and Dr. 
    Dave Clark from the Los Alamos National Laboratories 
    (LANL) and funded through the UCSD/LANL CARE Program 
    (CARE).
