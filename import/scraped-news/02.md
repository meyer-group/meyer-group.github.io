Congratulations to our PhD student Eva Zolnhofer! Her poster  “An Intermediate Cobalt(IV) Nitrido Complex” was awarded with the 1st  Poster-Prize (100 EUR) at the “ECOSTBIO Summer School “Spectroscopy of Spin in  Catalysis, Bioinorganic and Materials Chemistry: Spinning a Web of Theory and Practice”  in Groningen (Netherlands).  Well done Eva!!! 
A new postdoc arrived! 
Toni (Lianpeng) Tong received a M.Sc. degree   from Dalian University of Technology, China and  conducted his Ph.D.   research under the supervision of Prof. Licheng Sun at the KTH Royal   Institute of Technology, Stockholm in Sweden. He then proceeded to take a   postdoctoral position at the University of Houston (Prof. Randolph P.   Thummel) where he worked on the development of Co-based proton reduction   catalysts. At Erlangen he will be an integral part of our newly   established research team for the advancement of chemical energy   conversion sponsored by BMBF, "MANGAN".
