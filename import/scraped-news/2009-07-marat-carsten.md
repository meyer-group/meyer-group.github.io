Our heartiest congratulations to Dr. Marat Khusniyarov and Dr. Carsten Streb. 
Marat and Carsten were awarded a prestigious Liebig fellowship from the "Fonds der Chemischen Industrie".  
Marat has started his independent work in Mai 2009 and Carsten will join us in October 2009 for their independent research work towards their habilitation.                        

Marat obtained his PhD at Philipps-Universität Marburg with Prof. Jörg Sundermeyer (2006), afterwards he joined the group of Prof. Karl Wieghardt (MPI for Bioinorganic Chemistry) as a postdoctoral-fellow. 
Now he has started his independent research career focused on the development of photoswitchable magnetic materials funded by the FCI.

Carsten  Streb will join our team in October 2009 as a Liebig-Fellow of the FCI. 
Carsten  gained his Diplom-Chemiker degree at TU Kaiserslautern in 2005, working with Prof. Martin Hartmann. 
He then moved to the University of Glasgow where he obtained his PhD in 2008 (supervisor: Prof Lee Cronin) working on metal-oxide based molecular materials. 
Currently, he works at the University of Glasgow and James Watt Nanofabrication Centre, investigating complex functional nanostructures based on molecular metal oxide precursors. 
His future research will be focussed around alkoxide-based architectures as functional materials.
