Welcome to Stephanie Laga, a visiting Fulbright Fellow from  Caltech, Pasadena, USA!
After completion of her undergraduate education at   Caltech, she  decided to join our research team for a 10 months visit. During her time   in the  Meyer lab she will be working on Ni-NHC carbene complexes. After her   visit in Germany, she will be moving on to Yale University (New Haven,   USA) to start her graduate education  and PhD research. Congratulations to Stephanie for securing funding from   the  Fulbright Foundation. We are looking forward to fun times with her and   are  truly pleased to have her “on board”!
