A brand new solvent purification system                          (Glasscontour by George & Allison Meyer, Irvine, CA) for 10
  solvents has been installed! This system provides bone-dry and pristine
  solvents. Standard hydrocarbon solvents such as C5, C6, benzene and
  toluene as well as more problematic solvents like Et2O, THF, CH2Cl2,
  CHCl3, CH3CN and pyridine can be obtained dry and oxygen-free.
