title: "New Visiting Scholar: Dr. Alistair Frey"
---

Welcome to our guest Dr. Alistair Frey from the University of Sussex, Brighton, UK! 
He is visiting us for 4 weeks to breathe life into our infamous arsenic generator. 
It was build by our machine shop a while ago and has since been waiting to produce yellow arsenic for uranium chemistry. 
We are happy to  have Alistair in town and are looking forward to lots of chemistry and  camaraderie!
