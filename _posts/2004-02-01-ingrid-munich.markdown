Congratulations to Ingrid! 
Ingrid has received a research fellowship from the Bavarian Science Foundation. 
Ingrid is currently working in the laboratories of Prof. Matthias Tamm at the Technical University Munich (TUM) in Germany. 
Ingrid will stay in Bavaria during the holidays. 
We wish her all the best... and may be some snow (which Ingrid has never seen before ;-)
Come back soon!
