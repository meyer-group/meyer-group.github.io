title: New Established Workshop “Chemical Solar Energy Conversion via Redox-Active Metal Centers“ Sponsored by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft
---

This year, we are glad to announce the newly established workshop “Chemical Solar Energy Conversion via Redox-Active Metal Centers“ at our university (Sept. 24-27, 2007) sponsored by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. 
The main objective of this first workshop is an introduction to the field of solar energy conversion via electron transfer reactions. 
The emphasis is placed on the activation and, ultimately, cleavage of water to oxygen and hydrogen, utilizing sunlight as clean, renewable, and abundant source of energy. 
We are proud to have two speakers that are leaders in the field of homogeneous and heterogeneous approaches to water splitting. 
Professors A. Kudo and D. G. Nocera will be  presenting current challenges, advances, and perspectives in chemical solar energy conversion.
