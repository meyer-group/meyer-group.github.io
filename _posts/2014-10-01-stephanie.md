Welcome to Stephanie Laga, a visiting Fulbright Fellow from Caltech, Pasadena, USA!
After completion of her undergraduate education at Caltech, she decided to join our research team for a 10 months visit. 
During her time in the Meyer lab she will be working on Ni-NHC carbene complexes. 
After her visit in Germany, she will be moving on to Yale University (New Haven, USA) to start her graduate education and PhD research. 
Congratulations to Stephanie for securing funding from the Fulbright Foundation. 
We are looking forward to fun times with her and are truly pleased to have her “on board”!
