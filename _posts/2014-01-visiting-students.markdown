Welcome to all international guests staying with us for extended research stays!
Visiting from the United States are Matthew Chalkley (Yale University) and Donald Ripatti (University of California, San Diego). 
Both are undergraduate students and have been awarded research fellowships (Fulbright fellowship to MC, DAAD fellowship to DR) for a 9 months stay in our group before they will move on to begin their graduate education. 

Congratulations to both of them! Great to have you in the team!
