>According to Chemistry, Wine is a solution!

Yesterday, we had our annualy group trip to Martin Bauerschmitt's winery.
Instead of harvesting his wine like last year, we visit two more winerys to have a little tasting. 
It was a great day! 
Thanks to Martin and HÃ¶rx for all the organizations! <!--more-->
