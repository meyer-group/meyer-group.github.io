_Where are they now?_ 
Well, it is with great pleasure to note that the founding members of the Meyer group, Ingrid and Xile, continue their academic endeavors. 
After their postdoctoral research stays at the University of California, Berkley, and the California Institute of Technology, Ingrid and Xile started their independent careers at the California Maritime Academy and the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland. 

We wish them all the very best and success!
