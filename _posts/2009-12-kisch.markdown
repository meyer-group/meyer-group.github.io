title: Seminar of Prof. Charles Casey on July 20th 2009
---

The 365 winners of the 2009 ‘365 Landmarks in the Land of Ideas’ contest are in – and our colleague Prof. H. Kisch is one of them!
From  more than 2,000 applications received from companies, research institutes, art and cultural institutions, community and charity initiatives, a panel of 18 judges picked his research project “Frischluftfarbe” as one of the winners. 
As a result the “Institut für Anorganische Chemie” was selected as one of ‘365 Landmarks in the Land of Ideas’. 
Every landmark  demonstrates the multifaceted potential of Germany as a place of innovation. 
Congratulations to Prof. Kisch for his achievement and a big “Thank you” to him for bringing Inorganic Chemistry at Erlangen into the national limelight!
