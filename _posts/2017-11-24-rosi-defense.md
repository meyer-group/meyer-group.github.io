"You can call him Dr. Michael Rosenzweig now!" 
Our dearest collegue and friend Rosi had his PhD defense today. 
He was a member of the uranium team and graduated on the topic "Investigation of Bonding Properties and Electronic Structure in Tris(aryloxide) Supported Uranium Complexes"
Rosi was in the Meyer Group for five years and did always a very good job. 
With the motto "work hard, party hard" we celebrate the hole night. 
Rosi started to work for DOW Silicones Deutschland GmbH as a R&D Engineer.
They can be more than happy to have you!

All the very best & good luck for your future!
