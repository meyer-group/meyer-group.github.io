The first meyer-group student defended his PhD on November 18th 2004. 
The heartiest congratulations to Dr. Xile Hu. 
Xile... sorry, Dr. Hu graduated in four years with 10 publications. 
Xile will be continuing to do postdoctoral research with Prof. Jonas Peters at the California Institute of technology. 

All the best & good luck for the future!
