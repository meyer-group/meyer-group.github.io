Our  heartiest congratulations to Professor Daniel Mindiola (Indiana  University, Bloomington Indiana)! 
Dan has been granted the prestigious “Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel Research Award”. 
With this fellowship, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation awards internationally renowned scientists and scholars, who are producing cutting-edge achievements which have seminal influence on  their discipline beyond their immediate field of work. 
Dan & his family (Katti, Niobe & Juan Daniel) will be staying with us from May 29 through January 2010. 
Dan will be staying in his guest office on the 3rd floor of the Inorganic Chemistry building (Egerlandstr. 1, Office:  3.19). 
Please feel free to meet with  him; he is a super nice guy and a great synthetic chemist!
