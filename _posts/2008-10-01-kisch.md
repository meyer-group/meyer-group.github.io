---

On the occasion of his retirement, Prof. H. Kisch – one of our much respected Senior Colleagues – was honored during the “Festkolloquium – Katalyse mit und ohne Licht” in October 2008. 
About ~100 international guests joined the festivities in celebration of his very successful research career (see photo left with Prof. Schrauzer, UCSD (left), Profs.

Thank you Prof. Kisch for 25 years of committed service at the University of Erlangen!
