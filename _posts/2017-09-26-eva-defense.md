Congratulations to Eva, who defended her PhD thesis today! 
Eva was four years an important member of our group, always in a good mood and open-hearted.
Eva graduated in "Transition Metal Complexes of N-anchored N-heterocyclic Carbene Ligands: Synthesis, Characterization, and Reactivity".
Next to Eva's research, she was our EPR operator and we are very greatful for her patience and conscientiousness in measuring our samples. 
Eva will be continuing by working for FLAD & FLAD.

All the very best & good luck for the future!
