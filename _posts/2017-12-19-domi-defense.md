The heartiest congratulations to Dominik Halter - pardon - Dr. Dominik Halter who had his PhD defense today! <!--more-->
It's hard for us to accept that our best man is leaving now. 
He had always an open ear for question and he was always in a good mood for fun in the office.
A friend, we don't want to miss!
Dominik graduated with Summa Cum Laude in four years with 4 high impact first author papers.
To continue his impressive research work in the UK he recently recieved the ASC Researcher Mobility Fellowship to do postdoctoral research with Prof. Geoff Cloke at the University of Sussex.
Awesome, Domi!

All the very best & good luck for your future!
