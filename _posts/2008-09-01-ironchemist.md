This was a first! 
The Meyer group participated in the “Iron Chemist” competition here at the University of Erlangen. 
Although we nominated two teams (team U238 and Fe57) for the triathlon competition, we unfortunately were not quite as physically “fit” as some of the other teams and had to resort to our famous team spirit and sportsmanship to nevertheless enjoy the competition. 
This sportsmanship is clearly demonstrated in the picture below in which Dr. Jörg Sutter and Prof. Sven Rau are shaking hands as they pass the finish line at the same time!
Well done guys!
