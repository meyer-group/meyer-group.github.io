title: "New Postdoc: Amanda E. King"
---

Amanda E. King (University of Wisconsin, Madison) has been awarded an Alexander von Humboldt postdoctoral fellowship. 
Please join us in congratulating Amanda on this well deserved honor!

Amanda is currently working on her PhD thesis under the supervision of Profs. Shannon Stahl and Thomas Brunold. 
She is expected to join the Meyer lab for her postdoctoral studies in fall 2009. 
Amanda will be studying aspects of catalytic H2O oxidation, such as the  mechanism of oxygen – oxygen bond formation in high-valent transition metal oxo and hydroxo complexes. 
These studies are relevant to photo-catalytic water splitting chemistry as observed in the  biological oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of Photosystem II. 
The Meyer group is eagerly anticipating her arrival and extends our heartiest congratulations to Amanda!
