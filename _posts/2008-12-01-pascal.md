Congratulations to Paschalis Thasitis for finishing his Diploma thesis! 
Much to our regret, Paschalis is leaving us again, since he has accepted a very attractive job offer at a company back in his home country Greece in January 2009. 
For his efforts and hard work during his time in the Meyer lab, he was awarded a “Diploma hat”! Good luck for the future and we hope to see you again soon!
