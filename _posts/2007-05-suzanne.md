Dr. Suzanne Doucette (here with her husband Jarrod) has joined our group for her postdoctoral research. 
Suzanne comes from Paul Chirik's group @ Cornell University. 
She will study the coordination, activation, and functionalization of alkanes and CO2 at reactive, electron-rich uranium complexes in molecularly-engineered ligand environments.
